<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Microstructure Domain Ontology is intended to be a domain ontology
for physical metallurgy.  The intension is to cover all relevant
aspect of metallic microstructures, including:
  - composition
  - particles, both stable (primary) and metastable (precipitates)
  - grains
  - subgrains
  - grain boundaries & particle free zones (PFZs)
  - texture
  - dislocations
  - alloy systems

The aim is to support both microstructure modelling as well as
characterisation.

For modelling, we will distinguish between
  - evolution models (that changes the microstructure through a
    succession of states) and
  - property models (that relates a microstructure state to a property).

It should support describing same concept at different spatial
resolutions, like mean field, 1D, 2D and 3D.

For mean field descriptions (what about spatially resolved), it should
be possible describe quantities at different statistical levels, like
mean size, normalised size distribution (mean + standard deviation)
and full size distribution.

There should be a common way to connect a state to external
conditions, like temperature, volume/shape and pressure (essential for
describing a process).
